# GPM-SC & ProofPlay v2.0: Enterprise Verification Engine

**Current Version:** 2.0.0 (Production)
**Status:** Live on RapidAPI / Google Play / App Store

## 🚀 Overview
GPM-SC (General Purpose Meta-Symbolic Computation) has evolved from a simple gaming RNG into a **Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Logic Engine**. Version 2.0 introduces formal verification standards, cryptographic auditing, and legal compliance templates for Enterprise AI and Regulated Gaming.

## 💎 Key Features (v2.0)

### 1. Cryptographic "Black Box" Auditing (RFC 3161)
Every API interaction now generates a court-admissible audit receipt. This ensures non-repudiation for AI logic and gaming outcomes.

**Response Schema:**
```json
{
  "result": "Satisfiable",
  "proof": {
    "hash": "sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "anchor_id": "audit_8843a",
    "verification_method": "SMT_Z3"
  }
}
2. Standard SMT-LIB 2.6 Interoperability

We no longer just run logic internally. GPM-SC now exports logic proofs in the industry-standard SMT-LIB 2.6 format (.smt2).

Benefit: Enterprise security teams can verify our audit receipts using their own solvers (Microsoft Z3, CVC5, Yices) to confirm correctness without vendor lock-in.

3. Legal & Compliance Templates (MATL)

The engine now includes the Meta-Axiom Template Library (MATL) pre-loaded with axiomatic structures for:

GDPR/HIPAA: "If Data Subject is EU Citizen -> Obligation to Delete."

Contract Law: Conflict detection between normative clauses.

Paradox Resolution: Distinguishes between "Liar's Paradox" (Error) and "Law of Excluded Middle" (Valid).

4. "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) Architecture

To solve the "Unit Economics" of AI, v2.0 separates Logic Compute from LLM Compute.

Logic Verification (/verify/logic): FREE. Runs on our CPU-based Z3 cluster.

Generative AI (/ask, /synthesize): Cost pass-through. Users provide their own keys via headers.

Supported Headers:

X-Anthropic-Key: For Claude 3.5 Sonnet reasoning.

X-RapidAPI-Key: For metered billing and rate-limiting.

📚 API Reference (New Endpoints)
Method	Endpoint	Description	Cost
POST	/verify/logic	[NEW] Verify pure logical propositions using Z3. No LLM required.	Free
GET	/v2/usage	[NEW] Check remaining quota and current tier limits.	Free
POST	/v2/games/{id}/draw	[NEW] Draw a number with a guaranteed Cryptographic Receipt.	Paid
POST	/v2/certificate/{id}	[NEW] Generate a PDF compliance certificate for a transaction.	Paid
🔒 Security & Privacy
Ephemeral Processing: User API keys (X-Anthropic-Key) are used strictly for transient compute and are never stored in plain text.

Adversarial Hardening: Input guards block "DAN" mode and "Ignore Instructions" attacks.

DoS Protection: Free tier inputs are strictly bounded (2.0s timeout, 1000 char limit).
